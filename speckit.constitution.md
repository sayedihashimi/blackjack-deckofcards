# Speckit Constitution: Principles for Blackjack Deck of Cards

## 1. Code Quality
- All code must be readable, maintainable, and follow established style guides (e.g., PEP8 for Python, Google Java Style, etc.).
- Use meaningful variable, function, and class names.
- Avoid code duplication; prefer modular, reusable components.
- Document all public methods, classes, and modules with clear docstrings or comments.
- Perform regular code reviews to ensure adherence to standards.

## 2. Testing Standards
- All features and bug fixes must include automated tests (unit, integration, or end-to-end as appropriate).
- Maintain at least 90% code coverage for critical modules.
- Tests must be deterministic and not rely on external state or random outcomes unless explicitly mocked.
- Use descriptive test names and include clear assertions.
- Run the full test suite before merging any code changes.

## 3. User Experience Consistency
- UI elements must follow a consistent design language and interaction pattern.
- Provide clear feedback for user actions (e.g., button clicks, errors, loading states).
- Ensure accessibility standards are met (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support).
- Maintain responsive layouts for all supported devices and screen sizes.
- Document user flows and update them as features evolve.

## 4. Performance Requirements
- Application should load initial content in under 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
- Optimize rendering and minimize unnecessary re-renders or DOM updates.
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms for core game logic.
- Monitor and address memory leaks or performance bottlenecks.
- Profile and optimize critical paths before major releases.
